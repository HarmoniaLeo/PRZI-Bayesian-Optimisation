# PRZI-Bayesian-Optimisation

The `BSE.py` is refered from [Bristol Stock Exchange](https://github.com/davecliff/BristolStockExchange). We add our proposed PRBO algorithm to it. 

## Installation

```shell
git clone https://github.com/HarmoniaLeo/PRZI-Bayesian-Optimisation
cd PRZI-Bayesian-Optimisation
conda create --name PRZI-Bayesian-Optimisation --file requirements.txt
conda active PRZI-Bayesian-Optimisation
```

## Hyper-parameter Selections

To run the Hyperparameters Selection for PRSH, firstly run the command: 

```shell
python PRSH_hyper-parameters-experiments.py
```

The result can be found in `results/PRSH_results.csv`. Then use `PRSH_hyper-parameters-statistics.ipynb` to perform hypothesis tests and select the possibly optimized hyper-parameter combinations. 

To run the Hyperparameters Selection for PRBO, firstly: 

```shell
python PRBO_hyper-parameters-experiments.py
```

The result can be found in `results/PRBO_results.csv`. Then use `PRBO_hyper-parameters-statistics.ipynb` to perform hypothesis tests and select the possibly optimized hyper-parameter combinations. 

Intermediate result files generated by BSE will be saved in `results_buffer`. 

## Comparison between PRBO and PRSH

To run the comparison experiments, firstly run the command: 

```python
python PRBOvsPRSH_experiments.py
```

The result can be found in `results/PRBOvsPRSH_results.csv`. Then use `PRBOvsPRSH_statistics.ipynb` to perform hypothesis tests and view the comparison results. 

Intermediate result files generated by BSE will be saved in `results_buffer`.
